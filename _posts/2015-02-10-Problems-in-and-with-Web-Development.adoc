Hi everyone, how are you all!
Hope everything's good. 

I had been interacting with some of the Web Developers since last month. And after discussing with them; I came to conclusion that while developing for web, if it doesn't show any error, it is least bothered for correction or for the sake of coding style.

*What can be the possible solution?*

So we can inform the developer that it is wrong as per the coding style or it may lead to a possible bug.

I tried the editors which provide the Code Analysis; that is an explicit call to the analysis. Only few things like spell check, variable usage etc. But does help when we access any method from the unknown object in JavaScript i.e. Digging for the source of object and then resolution to its member method, or with CSS notifying about the position related issues, inability of certain properties to work in presence of other properties etc.

I came accross a tool, link:https://github.com/reworkcss/rework[rework], thich enables the working with CSS from node.js.

So similar things can be built which tell the developer alongside the development about the possible mistakes.

One other thing which I noticed is that the editors sometimes fail to dig the source of any object or class, which leaves the editor in confused state and it reports the very common type of error like *_Method used but not defined_*

Hope to see some solution. But I am currently working with link:http://www.sublimetext.com/3[Sublime Text 3] and link:https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/[JetBrains IDEA], ST3 is helping me with the normal web development where I am not working with any Server Side programming and IDEA is helping me with JAVA development along with AngularJS.
